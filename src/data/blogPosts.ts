      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Drip Irrigation</h2>
      <p>Drip irrigation is a revolutionary water-saving technique that delivers water directly to plant roots through a network of tubes, pipes, and emitters. This method can reduce water usage by up to 95% compared to traditional flood irrigation while significantly improving crop yields.</p>
      
      <h2 id="benefits">Benefits of Drip Irrigation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Uses 30-50% less water than conventional sprinkler systems</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Crop Quality:</strong> Consistent moisture levels lead to better fruit and vegetable quality</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Labor:</strong> Automated systems require minimal manual intervention</li>
        <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Water is delivered only to desired plants, reducing weed growth</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="implementation">Step-by-Step Installation Process</h2>
      <h3>1. Planning and Design</h3>
      <p>Start by mapping your field and determining water requirements for different crops. Consider factors like soil type, slope, and plant spacing.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Water Source Setup</h3>
      <p>Install a reliable water source with adequate pressure. This may include pumps, filters, and pressure regulators.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Main Line Installation</h3>
      <p>Lay the main distribution lines using PVC or polyethylene pipes. Ensure proper sizing based on flow requirements.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Lateral Line Setup</h3>
      <p>Install lateral lines with appropriate spacing for your crops. Use drip tape or tubing with built-in emitters.</p>
      
      <h3>5. System Testing</h3>
      <p>Test the entire system for leaks, pressure uniformity, and proper flow rates before final installation.</p>
      
      <h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance Tips</h2>
      <p>Regular maintenance is crucial for optimal performance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean filters weekly during peak season</li>
        <li>Check for clogged emitters monthly</li>
        <li>Inspect lines for damage after storms</li>
        <li>Flush the system at the end of each season</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="cost">Cost Considerations</h2>
      <p>While initial investment may seem high, drip irrigation systems typically pay for themselves within 2-3 years through water savings and increased yields. Government subsidies are often available to offset installation costs.</p>

      <h2 id="introduction">Solar Irrigation: The Future of Farming</h2>
      <p>Solar-powered irrigation systems are transforming agriculture by providing sustainable, cost-effective water management solutions. These systems harness solar energy to power water pumps, eliminating dependence on grid electricity and reducing operational costs.</p>
      
      <h2 id="benefits">Key Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero Electricity Bills:</strong> Complete independence from grid power</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Reduces carbon footprint significantly</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Consistent power supply even in remote areas</li>
        <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Solar panels require minimal upkeep</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="implementation">Government Schemes and Subsidies</h2>
      <h3>PM-KUSUM Scheme</h3>
      <p>The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan provides up to 60% subsidy on solar pump installations.</p>
      
      <h3>State-Level Incentives</h3>
      <p>Many states offer additional subsidies and benefits for solar irrigation adoption.</p>
      
      <h2 id="cost">Financial Analysis</h2>
      <p>A typical 5HP solar pump system costs around ₹4-5 lakhs but can save ₹50,000-80,000 annually in electricity costs.</p>
